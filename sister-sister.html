            <h1>SISTER SISTER MINISTRY</h1>
            <div class="sister-col">
                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>Sister Sister is a Ladies’ ministry established in 2015,
                     under Christhood International Outfield Ministries. </p> <br>
                     <p>We exist to raise young virtuous women to understand their 
                        worth in Christ, to manifest the standards of Christ, to 
                        maintain a healthy bond of unity in sisterhood
                         and to equip them to serve effectively in the body of 
                         Christ.</p> <br>
            </div>
            <h4>Our mission is to;</h4>
            <p>a. Sculpture godly womanhood by instilling
                scriptural virtues and empowering for service- 
                the natural countenance of feminine grace that
                 manifests as gentleness but divinely
                  designed as strength.</p> <br>
                  <p>b. Create a safe environment of relational well-being 
                    where girls and young women can find a network of sisters
                     and life-time legacy mentors, to bond in love and work 
                     together in various areas of Christian ministry as well as 
                    other spheres of life that need the virtuous lady to manifest
                    !</p> <br>
                    <p>With a doctrinally sound and engaging programmatic approach, 
                        Sister Sister seeks to not only meet every lady at her point
                         of need, but to empower her to evolve and reach the point of
                          her abundance! 
                        This is strategically achieved through the following;</p><br>
                 <dl>
                    <dt>Monthly Fellowships</dt>
                    <dd>
                        These serve as prayer 
                        gatherings and sittings with the King where the ladies
                         are stirred up to a lifestyle of devotion and awakened 
                         to release the unique offering of the virtuous woman. 
                         Esteemed speakers from the Ministry’s Leadership as well
                          as invited external ones handle with 
                        expertise and depth, relevant topics to the age-group present.
                    </dd>
                 </dl>
                 <dl><dt>Mentorship </dt>
                    <dd>
                        This is a very functional arm of Sister Sister 
                        where a platform is availed to either be a mentor
                         (for the spiritually mature) or to find a suitable mentor
                          (for the younger generation ladies).
                           This provides occasion for our ladies to come alongside a 
                           woman to model, invest and
                         train through lifestyle, life experiences, and Scripture.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                 
                 <dl>
                    <dt>	Cell-Group Families</dt>
                    <dd>These small groups enhance personal touch, transparency,
                         accountability and support amongst the ladies. They 
                         facilitate 
                        this through monthly plots and home visitation at 
                        group levels.</dd>
                    </dl>
                 
                 <dl>
            <dt>	Social Connection Getaways</dt>
        <dd>
            Several social events and retreats are 
            organized throughout the year to provide
                our ladies a chance to bond in a relaxed
                outdoor space, develop new friendships
                and strengthen existing ones, share 
                their lives with one another, have 
                corporate
                worship in the wild, and pursue quiet
                moments with God.
        </dd>
                </dl>
                 
                 <dl>
                    <dt>	Reach-out missions</dt>
                    <dd>
                        We believe in equipping our ladies so as to serve 
                        outside the saltshaker. Her unto whom much has been given,
                         much will be required- Luke 12:48. We therefore delightfully 
                         reach out to the communities around us all over the country 
                         with the 
                        love of Christ, particularly in schools and church conferences
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                 <p>Every lady who is an approved member of Christhood is 
                    automatically a member of Sister Sister. She participates 
                    in Sister Sister by giving back to Christhood Ministries
                     either financially or by volunteering services in other
                      ministry dockets such as Music Ministry, Creatives,
                     Protocol or any other Labor of Love within Christhood. </p> <br>  
                     <p>We believe that God has specially designed, packaged and 
                        unleashed women to shatter previous glass ceilings of
                         limitations and do incredible works in the world for His
                          Glory!</p>
