<p>Christhood Outfield International Ministries (CIOM) was 
    conceived in 2009 and started by its founder members. It 
    started as an outreach group that was concerned with the 
    lives and the souls of men and thus reaching them with the 
    Gospel of Christ Jesus: as well as equipping needy women 
    in the slums to enable 
    them do something with their hands to feed their families.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It was unveiled on 1st November 2009 with six programs: 
        Teen life, IFC, Impact, Branch, Sister Sister and BOKS,
         and is devoted to ministry through Outreach, Missions, 
         counseling, team building, 
        Training, and support. This is our hope and our prayer. </p><br>

            <p>We pray for great things and expect
                God to do great things. “Now to Him
                 who is able to keep you from stumbling,
                  and to make you stand in the presence of His 
                  glory blameless with great joy,” to Him, 
               we commit ourselves and the outcome of our service.</p>
