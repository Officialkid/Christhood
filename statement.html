        <h2>DOCTRINAL-STATEMENT</h2>
        <p>CIOM is an interdenominational ministry committed
             to the proclamation of God’s Word and exaltation
              of Jesus Christ through the power of the Holy
               Spirit. We exist to win, build and send believers so 
            they might impact their community, city, 
            and world for Christ.</p>
      
        
                <h3>THE BIBLE</h3>
         <p>The sole basis of our beliefs is the Bible, God’s infallible written Word, the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments. We believe that it was uniquely, verbally, and fully inspired by the Holy Spirit, without error (inerrant), immutable (unchanging), and universal (applies to all mankind). It is the supreme and final authority in all matters on which it speaks. Because of the
            specialized calling of our movement, we desire to allow for freedom of conviction on other doctrinal matters, provided that any interpretation is based on the Bible alone, and that no such interpretation shall become an issue which hinders the ministry to which God has called us.
            </p> <br>
            <h3>We explicitly affirm our belief in basic Bible teachings, as follows:</h3> <br>
            <p>• There is one true God, omnipotent (all powerful), omnipresent (everywhere), and omniscience (all knowing) triune God eternally existing in three persons-- Father, Son, and Holy Spirit-- each of whom possesses equally all the attributes of Deity and the
                characteristics of personality.
                </p> <br> 
                <p>• Jesus Christ is God, the living Word, who became flesh through His miraculous conception by the Holy Spirit and His virgin birth. Hence, He is perfect
                     Deity and true humanity united in one person forever.</p> <br><br>
                <p>• He lived a sinless life and voluntarily atoned for the sins of men by dying on the Cross as their
                    substitute, thus satisfying divine justice and accomplishing salvation for all who trust in Him alone. His death provides the basis of forgiveness and eternal security.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        He rose from the dead in the same body, though glorified, in which He lived and died.
He ascended bodily into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God the Father, where He, the only mediator between God and man, continually makes intercession for His own

                    </p> <br>
                    <p>• Man was originally created in the image of God. He sinned by disobeying God; thus, he was alienated from his Creator. That historic fall brought all mankind under divine condemnation.</p>
     <br>
     <p>• Man’s nature is corrupted, and he is thus totally unable to please God. Every
         man is in need of regeneration and renewal 
         by the Holy Spirit.</p><br>
         <p>• The salvation of man is wholly a work of God’s free grace alone and is not the work, in whole or in part, of human works or goodness or religious ceremony. God imputes His righteousness to those who put their faith in Christ alone 
            for their salvation, and thereby justifies 
            them in His sight.</p> <br>
            <p>• It is the privilege of all who are born again of the Spirit to be assured of their salvation from the very moment in which they trust Christ as their Savior. This assurance is not based upon any kind of human merit, but is produced by the witness of the Holy Spirit, who confirms 
                in the believer the testimony 
                of God in His written Word.</p> <br>
                <p>• The Holy Spirit has come into the world to reveal and glorify Christ and to apply the saving work of Christ to men. He convicts and draws sinners to Christ, imparts new life to them, continually indwells them from the moment of spiritual birth and seals them until the day of redemption. His fullness, power, and control are
                     appropriated in the believer’s life by faith.</p> <br>
                     <p>• The individual indwelling and empowering of every believer by the Holy Spirit upon conversion to live the Christian so that he will not fulfil the lust of the flesh 
                        but will bear fruit to the glory of God.</p> <br>
                        <p>• Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church, His Body, which is composed of all men, living and dead, who have been joined to Him through saving faith.
                             God admonishes His people to assemble together regularly for worship, for participation in ordinances, for edification through the Scriptures and for mutual encouragement.
                           At physical death the believer enters immediately into eternal, conscious fellowship with the Lord and awaits the resurrection of his body to everlasting glory and blessing.
                            </p> <br>
                            <p>• At physical death the unbeliever enters immediately into eternal, conscious separation from the Lord and awaits the resurrection of his body to everlasting judgment and condemnation.
                                • Jesus Christ will come again to the earth--personally, visibly, and bodily-- to consummate history and the eternal plan of God.
                                </p> <br>
                                <p>• The Lord Jesus Christ commanded all believers to proclaim the gospel throughout the world and to disciple men of every nation. The fulfilment of that Great Commission requires that all worldly and personal ambitions be subordinated to a total commitment to “Him who loved us and gave Himself for us.” Discipleship is a process in which a Christian with a life worth emulating invest his life for an extended period of time in a few individuals who have
                                    been won to Christ to guide and encourage their growth to maturity so they might reproduce themselves in a 3rd spiritual generation.
                                    </p> <br><br>
                                    <h3>We explicitly deny our belief in following: </h3> <br>
                                    <p>• That grace plus any work or faith plus any work are necessary for salvation. Works should and do come as a result of genuine saving faith.</p> <br>
                                    <p>• A plurality of mediators between God and man. There is one mediator-Christ and through him alone can we approach God.</p> <br>
                                    <p>• In Allegorical, Church, Rationalistic, Subjective, or Literalistic interpretations of the Bible. The God intended meaning of scripture lies in the grammatical, historical, contextual approach, which strives to understand the meaning to the original audience. </p>
                                    <br>
                                     <h3>STANDARDS OF MINISTRY</h3>
                                    <p>These apply to the CIOM leadership, staff, partners, volunteers and members. As leaders in the ministry together, we are committed to unity and love in the body of Christ, we are committed to </p><br>

                                        <li>• We will seek to be a team player by supporting each other and valuing the whole ministry.</li>
